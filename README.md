ðŸ“‚ Python Practice Repository (2024 â€“ 2025)

This repository contains Python programming practice exercises and small projects that I have worked on from 2024 to 2025. It includes problems on various concepts such as loops, functions, data structures, algorithms, file handling, and more. The purpose of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills and Python coding proficiency.

Each problem is organized by year and includes comments explaining the logic where necessary. This collection is helpful for beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their Python programming foundation.

âœ… Topics covered:

* Basic syntax and operations

* Conditional statements and loops

* Functions and recursion

* Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples

* File handling

* Algorithms and problem-solving techniques

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
